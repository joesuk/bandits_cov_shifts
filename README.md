This repository provides python code to run contextual bandit algorithms in synthetic environments with covariate shift. It reproduces the experimental results of the paper [Self-Tuning Bandits over Unknown Covariate-Shifts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08584) by Joe Suk and Samory Kpotufe, published in _ALT 2021_.

See the **experiments.ipynb** file to run experiments.
